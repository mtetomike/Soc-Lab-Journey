# Soc-Lab-Journey
Project 1: Build a SOC Lab

# 🛡️ Home SOC Lab Setup

## 🎯 Objective
Build a simulated Security Operations Center (SOC) environment to practice detecting and analyzing attacks.

---

## 🖥 Lab Environment

| Role | System |
|------|--------|
| Attacker | Kali Linux |
| Defender | Ubuntu Server |
| SIEM | Wazuh / Splunk |
| Network | Internal Virtual Network |

---

## 🧪 Attacks Simulated

- Nmap port scanning
- SSH brute force attempts
- EICAR malware test file
- Suspicious process simulation

---

## 🔍 Logs Observed

- `/var/log/auth.log`
- `/var/log/syslog`
- Journalctl logs
- SIEM alerts dashboard

---

## 🚨 Detection Techniques

- Multiple failed SSH login detection
- Port scan detection via SYN patterns
- File integrity monitoring alerts
- Suspicious process monitoring (`ps aux`, `top`)

---

## 🛡 Security Concepts Practiced

- Log analysis
- Intrusion detection
- Network segmentation
- Incident response basics

---

## 📌 Key Learning Outcome

Understood how real SOC analysts:
- Monitor logs
- Detect reconnaissance activity
- Investigate suspicious authentication attempts
- Correlate events across systems
